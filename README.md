# Sparse Generation: Making Pseudo Labels Sparse for point weakly supervised object detection on low data volume


Sparse Generation uses non-networked approach and direct regression on pseudo labels. In three processing stages (Mapping, Mask, Regression), Sparse Generation constructs initial tensors through the relationship between data and detector model, optimizes its parameters, and obtains a sparse tensor, addresses the modelâ€™s density problem on low data volume. 


## Environment: 
    python >=3.7.
    pytorch >=1.9.0.
    our cuda version is 11.6.
    
## Dataset:
Due to the need to obtain instances as dense as possible, we conducted Bullet-Hole data set collection in a real shooting range.In these photos with the highest number of bullet holes contain over 600 bullet holes in a single picture. Link for downloading the pictures and annotations: (https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Qg-3FOer2x0TS55I9ZzEVQ?pwd=abcd).

The other datasets used in our experiment:
MS COCO dataset (https://cocodataset.org/#download)
RSOD dataset (https://github.com/RSIA-LIESMARS-WHU/RSOD-Dataset-.git)
SIMD dataset (https://github.com/ihians/simd.git)


## How to run:
Only need to use a small set of supervised annotation data to train a pre-model, use this pre-trained model to predict the pseudo labels on entire dataset.
We validated on four different datasets(MS COCO-5000, RSOD, SIMD, Bullet-Hole).

### pre-trained weights
The pre-trained weights for yolov5s on MS COCO-5000, RSOD-aircraft, RSOD-oiltank, SIMD:

**using the pre-trained weights we provided, or you can train your own pre-trained weights.**

### Point labels

put the original box labels of train set to point labels derictory, the code will convert them to coarse point labels without manual intervention.

### Prediction and generation pseudo labels

Example for prediction using yolov5s:

    python detect.py --weights 'your weights' --source 'image directory path' --save-txt

If your detector model output the COCO json or VOC format annotation, transforming them to yolo txt format. Using Sparse Generation to generate pseudo labels predicted by the detector.

   The initial parameters were already set. run command:
    
     python Sparse_Generation.py --inferenced_labels_URL --Sparse_Generation_save_URL --val_labels_URL --inferenced_val_labels_URL --Sparse_generation_val_labels_save_URL --point_labels_URL --epochs --Final_save_URL  
 

1. "point_labels_URL" is the folder path to put the Point-annotation data.

2. "inferenced_labels_URL" is the folder path to put predicted pseudo labels.

3. "Sparse_Generation_save_URL" is the output derictory of Sparse Generation, which in yolo txt format for easy to demonstration.

4. "Final_save_URL" is the final output derictory of Sparse Generation.

5. "epochs" is to set the epochs for parameter updating.

6. "val_labels_URL" is the folder path to put the small amount supervised labels.

7. "inferenced_val_labels_URL" is to set the path which pseudo labels predicted from the small amount supervised pictures.
