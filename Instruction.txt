## 1.  Only need to use a very small set of supervised annotation data(like 8 pictures depends on the dataset) to Train a pre-model, use this pre-trained model to predict the pseudo labels on entire dataset.
##
## 2. "point_labels_URL" is the folder path to put the Point-annotation data.

## 3. "inferenced_labels_URL" is the folder path to put predicted pseudo labels.

## 4. "Sparse_Generation_save_URL" is the output derictory of Sparse Generation, which in yolo txt format for easy to demonstration.

## 5. "Final_save_URL" is the final output derictory of Sparse Generation.

## 6. "epochs" is to set the epochs for parameter updating.

## 7. "val_labels_URL" is the folder path to put the small amount supervised labels.

## 8. "inferenced_val_labels_URL" is to set the path which pseudo labels predicted from the small amount supervised pictures.


##  If your detector model output the COCO json or VOC format annotation, transforming them to yolo txt format.

##  The other initial parameters were already set.

Environment: 
    python >=3.7 is ok.
    pytorch >=1.9.0 is ok.
    our cuda version is 11.6.

How to run:
    command: #
